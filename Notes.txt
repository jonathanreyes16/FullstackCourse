NEXT.js Introduction
how NEXTjs 
    - works
    - benefits   
    - applications
    - production optimization

- What is react
react lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.
When referring to user innterfaces, we are alluding to the visual elements that users interact with on their screens.

React serves as a library that supplies advantageous functions for constructing UI but ultimately places the decision
on the developer as to where to impleet those functions within their application.

building a complete page takes some time.

- What is next.js
is a flexible react framework that gives you builidng blocks to create fast web applications.
By frmawork, we mean next.js handles the toolig and configuration needed for react, and provides aditional structure,
featuresm and optimizations for your applications.

flexible react framework,, that provides the foundations to create fast web applications.

- Routinng 
a file based router build on top of server components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states,error handling,
and more

- Rendering

- Data fetching
simplified data fetching with async/await support in react components ad the fetching

-optimizations
comes with some build it optimizations to improve speed and core web vitals.
enhance user experiece

NEXTjs
serverside renderinng
React based framework
specifically developed to imporove react.js SEO
web applications are high performance

-Use of next.js
ecomerce:
    with the support for server side rendering. is a excellent choice for building e-commerce websites that 
    required fast loading times and high performance.

other examples: ticketmaster, twitch, nike
can reduce the data needed to show images
intelingent prefetching, build in cache
high performance - great user experience

-NEXT js Basics

- development and production env
dev stage:
    optmizes for the developer and their experience building application.

    - TS
    - ESlint
    - Fast Refresh

production stage:
    ext.js optimizes for the end-users. and their experience usig the application. it aimms to trasform the code
    to make it performant and accesible.

    - compiled
    - imnnified
    - bunbled
    - code split

-

- minifying
process of removing unecessary code formating ad comments without changing the code functionality.
the goal is to improve the application performance by decreasing file sizes.
Faster and better user experience.
minified automatically by NEXTjs

- bundling
is the process of resolving the web of depedencies and merging (or packaging) the files (or modules) into optimized
bundlesfor the browser,, with the goal of reducig the number of requests for files when the user visits a webpage.

- Code splitting
is the process of spliting the applications bunlde into smaller chunks required by each etry point. The goal is to 
improve the application initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page.

- Rendering
there is a unavoidable unit of work to convert the code you write in react into the HTML representation of your ui.
this process is called redering. Rendering can take place o server side, cliet side rendering

- CSR client side rendering
only the barebones HTML container for a page is rendered by the server. The logic, data fetching, templating
and routing requred to display cointet ont he page is handled by js code that executes on the client browser

view the page untill the end


serversend response> browser download JS> browser executes> site visible


- SSR Server side rendering
the Html of the page is generated on a server for each request. the generated HTML, json data, and javascript instructtion
to make the page iteractive are set to the client

Server sendign ready to be rendered HTML> browser reder the age, now viewable and browser download js > browser execute react > page now interectable 
can view the page but interact once the js is download

- static site generating
the HTML is generated on the server, content is generated once, at build time, whe the application is deployed
and the Html is stored in a CDN and reused for each request.

CDN store static content (such as html)


- when?
CSR     
when we want a high level of interactivity, SEO not priority

SSG
fast, secure and easy to deploy.
static content such as blog or news website, portfolio.

SSR
improve then performance of ann application whe the user have a slower internet conection
when we have less logic than CSR
